# Never know how to introduce myself

## Introduction

>Hello everyone, my name is Liu Tao, and you can call me Tao. I graduated from Jimei University with a major in Electronic Information Engineering, where I studied under Professor Xu. Professionally, I'm in the internet industry and work as a programmer. I enjoy watching comedies, which probably explains why I laugh so often. In my spare time, I like to shoot some hoops, though nothing too intense. More often, you'll find me listening to music or tinkering with my camera. thank you！
